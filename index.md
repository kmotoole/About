### About

I have always been intrigued by how creativity and innovation occur across different disciplines, and how technology can be used to help facilitate creative endeavors and innovation through collaboration. I am also interested in the effects that technology and computing have on larger social networks and group behavior, as well as the ability of technology to connect us and change the way ideas are developed and disseminated. My research focuses on developing a better understanding of creativity, especially within existing social contexts and networks, and applying this knowledge to design tools that will help users be more innovative and creative.
